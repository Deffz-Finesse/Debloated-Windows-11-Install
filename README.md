# **Debloated Windows 11 Installation** üöÄ

This project contains an unattended Windows 11 installation configuration that bypasses hardware checks, removes unnecessary bloatware, disables certain Windows services, and applies custom configurations for an optimized, streamlined experience.

The unattended installation automates the process of setting up Windows with minimal user intervention, while simultaneously removing a variety of built-in apps, optimizing system settings, and improving overall performance. Below is a detailed explanation of everything that the configuration does to the system.
